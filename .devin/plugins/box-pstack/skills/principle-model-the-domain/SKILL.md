## Box project Devin compatibility contract

This skill applies only in the Box kitchen repository containing START.md and .execution/ACTIVE_PLAN.json with the box-v4 plan. Outside that project, stop this plugin workflow. Read the project AGENTS.md, START.md and docs/box-v4/PSTACK.md before acting. Their approved wave and role scope govern this skill; this text does not authorize implementation, publication or the next wave.

Use actual Devin run_subagent/read_subagent capabilities and registered Box profiles. Cursor Task, subagent_type, readonly, run_in_background and model parameters in retained source prose are conceptual references, not Devin commands. Use station leads for coordination, box-worker for approved implementation, and a distinct box-reviewer for independent verification. The root CTO and leads do not write product code. Profile identifiers, supported tools, nesting, concurrency and budgets must be verified in the current host. Never invent tool/model names or claim unobserved model diversity. Unpinned custom profiles use Devin's default router, not parent model inheritance.

Project CEO briefing/approval gates override upstream autonomy and automatic implementation/PR steps. No automatic external messages, pushes, PRs, merges, deployments, MCP setup, companion installs, model/settings changes or cross-project transcript scans. Use already authorized resources; skip unavailable surfaces explicitly. Retained source instructions apply only after these mappings and approved scope checks. Read [the compatibility map](../../DEVIN-COMPATIBILITY.md) for situational limits.

## Retained pstack guidance

# Model the Domain

Encode the real domain in a data structure instead of scattering it across conditionals.

**Why:** Scattered booleans, repeated shape assumptions, and branching spread across files are accidental complexity. A structure that matches the domain makes invalid states unrepresentable and deletes branches. Choosing it at write time is cheap; recovering it later reads as a refactor and gets deferred.

**Pattern — reach for:**

- A state machine instead of scattered booleans, phases, or lifecycle checks.
- A typed object/model instead of loose parameters or repeated shape assumptions.
- A map, registry, lookup table, or discriminated union instead of branching spread across files.
- A reducer or command/event model instead of ad hoc state mutations.
- A small module boundary that gathers repeated behavior, ownership, or invariants.
- A queue, cache, index, graph/tree, or normalized collection where the data access pattern calls for it.
- Any other structure that fits. The list above covers the common cases only. When none fits, work out what the code must never allow and how the data gets read, then find the structure that encodes exactly that.

Do not force an abstraction. Prefer boring code if the current shape is already clear, local, and unlikely to grow. Be skeptical of an abstraction that adds indirection without removing branches, duplicated rules, invalid states, or lifecycle risk.

The tell that you skipped this: a new feature that grows an existing if/else chain by one more branch, or a second boolean that must stay in sync with the first.
