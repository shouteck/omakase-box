Reference material for the Box kitchen only. AGENTS.md and docs/box-v4/KITCHEN.md are the rules; this skill never grants authority, approves work or changes who decides what. Where the retained text below names Cursor tools, cloud workers, pull requests, model slugs or automatic shipping, treat it as an idea and use what this host actually has.

# Boundary Discipline

Place validation, type narrowing, and error handling at system boundaries. Trust internal code unconditionally. Business logic lives in pure functions; the shell is thin and mechanical.

**Why:** Scattered validation is noisy, redundant, and gives a false sense of safety. Validate data once at the boundary. Keep logic out of framework wiring so it can be tested without the framework.

**The pattern:**
- **At boundaries** (CLI args, config files, external APIs, network protocols): validate, return errors, handle defensively.
- **Inside the system:** typed data, error propagation, no re-validation. Trust the types.

**Applications:**

Validation and error handling:
- Validate config at parse time (the boundary), not inside business logic
- Store raw data at boundaries; parse lazily at use-site
- No redundant nil checks deep in call chains if the boundary already validated

Code organization:
- Business logic in pure functions with no framework dependencies
- Parse functions: pure transforms from raw bytes to typed state
- Prompt construction: structured state in, string out
- Scoring and assessment: pure transforms from state to results

**The tests:**
- "Is this data crossing a system boundary right now?" If not, validation is redundant.
- "Can this be a pure function that the shell just calls?" If yes, extract it.
