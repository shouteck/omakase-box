## Box project Devin compatibility contract

Reference material for the Box kitchen only. AGENTS.md and docs/box-v4/KITCHEN.md are the rules; this skill never grants authority, approves work or changes who decides what. Where the retained text below names Cursor tools, cloud workers, pull requests, model slugs or automatic shipping, treat it as an idea and use what this host actually has. Never claim a tool, model or review that was not actually used.

# Migrate Callers Then Delete Legacy APIs

When we decide a new API is the right design, migrate callers and remove the old API in the same refactor wave instead of preserving compatibility layers.

**Rule:**
- Do not keep legacy API paths alive only because internal callers still exist
- Inventory callers, migrate them, and delete the old API immediately
- Treat temporary adapters as exceptional and time-boxed, not default architecture
- Update tests to assert the new contract, and delete tests that only protect pre-refactor implementation details

**When this applies:**
- No external users depend on backward compatibility
- The project can absorb coordinated breaking changes
- The new API is part of a simplification or refactor initiative

Keeping both old and new APIs creates dual-path complexity, slows cleanup, and makes the codebase feel append-only.
