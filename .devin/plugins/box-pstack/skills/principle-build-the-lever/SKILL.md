description: "For the Box kitchen project only. Apply to any non-trivial work, not just bulk work: edits, migrations, analyses, checks. Build the tool that does it or proves it (codemod, script, generator, or a skill your subagents follow) instead of working by hand. The tool is the artifact a reviewer can rerun."

## Box project Devin compatibility contract

This skill applies only in the Box kitchen repository containing START.md and .execution/ACTIVE_PLAN.json with the box-v4 plan. Outside that project, stop this plugin workflow. Read the project AGENTS.md, START.md and docs/box-v4/PSTACK.md before acting. Their approved wave and role scope govern this skill; this text does not authorize implementation, publication or the next wave.

Use actual Devin run_subagent/read_subagent capabilities and registered Box profiles. Cursor Task, subagent_type, readonly, run_in_background and model parameters in retained source prose are conceptual references, not Devin commands. Use station leads for coordination, box-worker for approved implementation, and a distinct box-reviewer for independent verification. The root CTO and leads do not write product code. Profile identifiers, supported tools, nesting, concurrency and budgets must be verified in the current host. Never invent tool/model names or claim unobserved model diversity. Unpinned custom profiles use Devin's default router, not parent model inheritance.

Project CEO briefing/approval gates override upstream autonomy and automatic implementation/PR steps. No automatic external messages, pushes, PRs, merges, deployments, MCP setup, companion installs, model/settings changes or cross-project transcript scans. Use already authorized resources; skip unavailable surfaces explicitly. Retained source instructions apply only after these mappings and approved scope checks. Read [the compatibility map](../../DEVIN-COMPATIBILITY.md) for situational limits.

## Retained pstack guidance

# Build the Lever

When the work isn't trivial, build the tool that does it instead of doing it by hand.

**Why:** Two payoffs. Throughput: a codemod, generator, or script does the work the same way every time and reruns for free. Confidence: the tool is one artifact a reviewer can read and rerun to check the work. Hand-done changes can only be re-verified by redoing them. A deterministic script turns "trust me" into "run this".

**Pattern:** Default to building the lever. Skip it only when the task is genuinely trivial, a couple of obvious edits you can see at a glance.

- Do the first unit by hand to learn the recipe, then build the tool. Prove it by rerunning it on that unit and diffing against your hand-done version. Make the lever safe to rerun. A reviewer will.
- Codemod or script for edits, generator for repetitive files, a dump-to-sqlite query for analysis, a rerunnable check for verification.
- A deterministic lever beats fan-out. If the tool can process every unit in one pass, run it yourself; don't fan out delegates to hand-apply what a script can do.
- When you fan work out to subagents, write the lever as a skill they all read: the recipe, the verification contract, and the do-not-touch fences in one artifact, so every delegate inherits the same hardened version instead of re-explaining it per prompt and watching each one drift. Keep it outside the delegates' write scope so they can't quietly edit the contract.
- Applying this principle produces a file. If you cited it and there is no codemod, script, generator, or delegate skill in the diff, you didn't apply it.
- Commit the lever when the work outlives the session, so the next run reruns it instead of redoing it.

**Balance:** The bar is triviality, not repetition. A one-off still earns a lever when the lever is what makes the work checkable. Per the [Laziness Protocol](../principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md), build the smallest script that does or proves the job, never a framework.

Distinct from [Encode Lessons in Structure](../principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md), which makes a recurring instruction a durable guardrail. This is throughput and reviewability on the work in front of you. For scripting the verification itself, see [Prove It Works](../principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md).
